    **Download Credential Report:**

    Using Management Console:
    1. Login to the AWS Management Console
    2. Click `Services`
    3. Click `IAM`
    4. Click on `Credential Report`
    5. This will download an `.xls` file which contains credential usage for all users within an AWS Account - open this file

    Via CLI
    1. Run the following commands:
    ```
     aws iam generate-credential-report
     aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d | cut -d, -f1,4,5,6,9,10,11,14,15,16
    ```
    **Ensure unused credentials does not exist:**
    2. For each user having `password_enabled` set to `TRUE` , ensure `password_last_used_date` is less than `90` days ago.
    - When `password_enabled` is set to `TRUE` and `password_last_used` is set to `No_Information` , ensure `password_last_changed` is less than 90 days ago.
    3. For each user having an `access_key_1_active` or `access_key_2_active` to `TRUE` , ensure the corresponding `access_key_n_last_used_date` is less than `90` days ago.
    - When a user having an `access_key_x_active` (where x is 1 or 2) to `TRUE` and corresponding access_key_x_last_used_date is set to `N/A', ensure `access_key_x_last_rotated` is less than 90 days ago."

    1. Login to the AWS Management Console:
    2. Click `Services`
    3. Click `IAM`
    4. Click on `Users`
